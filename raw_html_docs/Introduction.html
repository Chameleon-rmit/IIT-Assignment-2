(and website) is for Assignment Two of RMIT’s Introduction to
Information Technology (in Study Period Four of 2020). The Assignment
calls for several sections ranging from information about our team
(both individually and collectively) to information on several
aspects of the IT industry to our reflection on our team and on
aspects of the IT industry. One of the more important sections is
describing in detail an IT Project that our team has chosen that will
be realised (at least in part) in later Assignments in this course.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%"><font color="#4472c4"><span lang="en-AU">The
project that our team chose is a simple idea that will save time for
people who write reports that feature a lot of reused sentence
fragments (doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, and really
anyone who potentially writes reports on mobile devices). The most
appropriate technology to use for the prototype, and perhaps even the
finished product, is a Progressive Web Application.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%"><font color="#4472c4"><span lang="en-AU">Our
project being a Progressive Web Application has had a direct
influence upon the website portion of this Assignment. There isn’t
any prescription in the requirements of the Assignment as to what the
website needs to be (other than that it must contain the same content
as the report). As such we<!-- ... I say "we" as though the group had input on the decision but I pretty much arbitrarily decided to do it :P I'm comfortable enough with the surrounding technologies (web programming) that even though I've never done a Progressive Web App I'll be able to get it done with only a little more effort than a typical website (to the standard I would do a typical website, anyway) -->
have decided to do a Progressive Web Application for that portion.<!-- And I've used half a page just to get to the point of justifying why the website will basically be a mobile application :P My feeling is that the introduction should be short (definitely less than a page) and interesting to give good momentum going into the report. --></span></font></p>
