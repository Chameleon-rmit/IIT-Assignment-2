  <h2>Job Titles</h2>

  <p>
  <h3>What are the Job Titles for
    your group's ideal jobs?<br />How do each of these rank in terms of demand
from employers? </h3>
Looking
at IT Job Titles data <i>(refer
appendix table 7)</i> provided by Burning Glass Technologies
(BGT) shows that from a total of 120,353 job listings made between
24th March 2017 and 23rd March 2018, the top IT job listing was
Solutions Architect with 987 listings accounting for less than 1% of
the total. A common job title within our group involves Software
Developer/Engineer <i>(table
6),</i> which in this data accounts for 539 job listings, or
just 0.45% of the total listings. When you compare these results to
the Top Occupations data <i>(refer
appendix table 8) </i>provided by BGT, from 121,997 job
listings made between 1st March 2017 and 28th February 2018, the top
occupation was shown to be Software Engineer/Developer with 29,456
openings, accounting for almost a quarter of all listings made in
this period. 
  </p>
  <p>
This
seems to indicate that employers may be having difficulty describing
what they are looking for when placing a job opening online. Further
to this, data taken from the report ‘Skills of Mass Disruption:
Pinpointing the 10 Most Disruptive Skills in Tech’ (Burning Glass
Technologies 2020), states “In the past 12 months, there were
1,714,483 U.S. job openings requesting at least one of the disruptive
skill areas.” This report shows that the Software
Development/Engineer occupation is involved in all 10 disruptive
skill areas in demand by the industry.

  <h3>
How do the IT-specific skills in your required
skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
  </h3>
  <p>
Looking
at the data from Burning Glass Technologies<i> (refer
appendix table 10), </i>our
group’s skill set encompasses several of the abilities
that are in demand. The largest demands that meet our group’s IT
specific skill set include SQL, Javascript, Microsoft Windows
and JAVA. These account for almost half of all IT
skills shown to be in demand. 
  </p>
  <h3>
How do the general skills in your required
skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
  </h3>
  <p>
Looking
at our group’s ideal job descriptions provides several general
skills required to obtain employment within our respective
areas. For example, all jobs require communication skills, which
also correlates with data from BGT showing that over a third of job
listings (36.4%) were looking for someone who can demonstrate this
skill. Interestingly, teamwork/collaboration, which would
normally be attributed within communication, only accounted for
11.8%. This is most likely due to employers believing that one of
these is not exclusive of the other. As a group there were very few
general skills not required within our skill set. In fact, the top
four skills in our group are communication skills, problem solving,
organizational skills and writing, which make up 75% of skills in
demand by employers.

  <h2>Opinions</h2>
  <h3>
Having looked at the Burning
Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed?<br />Why or why
not?
  </h3>
  <p>
After
discussing the Burning Glass data within our team, we found that
while certain roles, such as the title of Product Manager sought by
Alexis, was not specifically mentioned in the data or that while
Ayub’s ideal job had a lower demand, that overall, our opinions of
our ideal jobs have not changed. This is mostly attributed to the
level of discovery we each completed during assignment 1 which
involved gaining an understanding of our own skills, personalities,
and IT interests. 
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li><i>Alexis Satre</i> - My
	opinion of a product manager has changed as I was
	surprised to find that it isn’t listed as an occupation,
	although there were nearly equivalent titles listed
	including Software Development Manager, Technical Manager and
	Solutions Designer. My efforts to gain experience might be better
	directed towards these roles and I would probably even prefer
	to focus on more defined careers that would be easier to find
  experience in, particularly Software Developer. </li>
	<li><i>Ayub Khayre
	</i>- After
	reviewing the information that was provided my ideal job has
	not changed. This is due to my current position as a level 1
	helpdesk officer. However, looking at the data I can see
	that the demand for employees for my ideal job is very low
	(currently sitting at 7.7%). This did make me realise that I
	may need to widen the scope of my ideal job by looking into
	other similar sectors that have a higher demand for
  employees.  </li>
	<li><i>David Egan</i> - Reviewing
	the information within the Burning Glass data has both
	helped to reinforce my ideal job choice and helped to
	direct my focus towards a more Software Developer/Engineering
	focused role. Specifically looking at the list of disruptive
	skills shown in the report, with a projected growth of up to
	135%, and with 30% of skills already requested by employers,
  opportunities are only going to continue to grow further.  </li>
	<li><i>Jarrad Elvey</i> - My
	opinion of my ideal job hasn’t changed after looking at the data.
	Why would there be a correlation between what is most popular and
	what is most ideal to me? The most interesting jobs are going
	to be outside the norm and my stated ideal job was so stated
  because of the interesting work it would provide. </li>
	<li><i>Jonathan Seah</i> - I
	believe my choice of ideal job is related to one of the
	disruptive skills mentioned in the Burning Glass report (machine
	learning), reading the report has only reinforced my impression that
  computing technology and AI will be important in the future.   </li>
  </ul>
