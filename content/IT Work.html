<h3>
Please tell us about your IT work. Who do you
work for, your qualifications and what exactly do you do? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A</b>.
I work as a full stack developer for Longevum Pty Ltd, a Health tech
startup that offers a platform to doctors to better manage patient's
health data. I have a master’s in InfTech(Business) degree. Most of
the time is spent coding on different platforms that are already in
use and are in multiple codebases.  
</p>
<h3>
What is your schedule like today for example? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
Work starts at 8 am, ends usually by 5pm which includes 1 hour lunch
break. After work is mostly a leisure time.  
</p>
<h3>
Please tell us about the industry or area your
company is involved in. 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
The company focuses on the health-tech sector. It is a common
understanding that one has to visit a doctor to discuss any health
concerns that they might have.  There is substantial data that shows
that these concerns can be symptoms to catch early onset of
life-altering conditions and diseases such as diabetes, cancer, BP,
cardiac health, or Blood-borne diseases. Innovation and technology
can now enable doctors and patients to manage their health in an
easier and more maintainable way without an overhead of cost and
time.  
</p>
<h3>
What other kinds of work do you have to do that
might not be in your job description? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A</b>.
Other responsibilities include creating and modifying the design
files, creating or designing a new user interface. 
</p>
<h3>
Who are all the different people you interact
with in your work? Please tell us about them. (Are they other IT
professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?) 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A</b>.
My job requires me to interact with the Manager, Software Devs and
Testers. These are usually all IT professionals. 
</p>
<h3>
Please tell us about your interactions with other
IT professionals within your company and externally. 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
A majority of the time we discuss problems we face and how to tackle
them, we start by explaining the problem. perhaps even showing or
recreating it. Once the root cause is identified we try to find the
first working solution by a verbal discussion. Occasionally any new
and interesting finds are also discussed. Apart from that all other
interactions are friendly and cheerful. 
</p>
<h3>
What do you look for in a job opportunity? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
Most important factors that everyone should consider before taking up
a job is that your interests align with what the job description
says. There should be enough growth and learning opportunities in a
job for any entry level individual to learn. The culture of the
company is also something to consider. This you can find out by
speaking with past employees on LinkedIn or through mutual contacts. 
</p>
<h3>
Do you have any interactions with clients or
investors? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
None, that is handled by the manager. 
</p>
<h3>
What aspects of your work do you spend most time
on? What proportion of time do you spend
planning/coding/documentation/version control? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
Every piece of work to do is documented in the form of Jira tickets,
planning of the tickets/user stories are done by analysts or managers
with occasional involvement from developers like me. Coding takes the
most time as it takes time to derive a sound solution to a given
problem irrespective of its complexity. Usually, documentation is not
needed unless you are editing a library function or creating a
utility function to use as deemed necessary. The majority of my time
is spent on coding. 
</p>
<h3>
Which aspects of your work do you find most
challenging and which do you find most enjoyable? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
Writing sound solutions to a given problem while taking care that the
problem won’t repeat is definitely the most challenging and
enjoyable. There have been times where I’ve spent weeks on a single
task. Delivering on time is always a challenge as there may be some
unforeseen issues that need to be dealt with. 
</p>
<h3>
Can you share an example of the work you do that
best captures the essence of the IT industry? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
A typical example would be creating a search functionality that
searches for entities based on their attributes or relations. Let's
say we have a table called ‘DOCTOR’ and a table called ‘PRACTICE’
and a many-to-many relationship pivot table ‘DOCTOR-PRACTICE’
which holds the information of which doctor belongs to which
practice. There could be many doctors in one practice, and one doctor
could belong to multiple practices. Using the pivot-table we can
write an API service that looks up the pivot table and returns the
matched results. We could also modify the service to match and return
doctors using their name or discipline; or we could enhance it
further by matching all doctors in a practice using the postcode.  
</p>
<p>
Once
the work is complete, it goes through a number of rigorous tests.
Often times a critical bug is found in tests which makes them an
important yet underrated process. 
</p>
<h3>
Where do you want your career to go from here? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
I have not decided where I want to take my career from here yet. I
see myself working for my current employer for the foreseeable
future. For now, I want to advance my career by acquiring skills and
knowledge that will make me a better software developer. 
</p>
<h3>
What are your biggest tips to new IT
professionals and students? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
To get better at software development, practice coding as much as you
can, even make it a habit. Learn the lingo. Know the industry
standards, learn coding patterns, the whole process. Keep an open
mind - don’t let anyone project their opinion about a certain
technology on you. Know the pros and cons yourself. Become a
self-taught developer - be motivated to keep learning and make time
for it. 
</p>
<h3>
Is there anything from your workday that you also
do at home? Do you have any IT related hobbies? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
Yes, I do. On weekends I would normally make time for coding,
creating a simple project in a new framework in the process of
learning it. Reading blogs related to IT has been a hobby for a
couple of years now.  
</p>
<h3>
How has the pandemic affected how you work? 
</h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
The pandemic made it challenging to communicate and perform daily
duties, interact with colleagues. Working from home can sometimes be
distracting and not everyone has the same setup to work from home. In
my case, my home computer does not have the work environment needed
to work from. It is a tedious and time-consuming process to set it
all up. 
</p>
<h3>
Last time we
spoke you mentioned that some of your fellow graduates had found that
they weren’t getting a lot of mentorship or career development as
programmers in some of the jobs they had taken. Can you explain how
that works from your perspective?  
</h3>
<div>
(transcribed
from audio, see appendix Audio 1) </div>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
Usually, companies that are large companies with different products
and different teams have graduate programs, but don't really have
mentors. Everything is documented - the process is all documented and
they get you to do small projects and themes and progress that way
too, but not really have on-product experience or exposure. 
</p>
<p>
That
sort of hinders them from even progressing in that company. It might
not be a good experience to start that way. It might be better to
start at a start-up company and work your way up and understand the
whole ecosystem. That's what I do. 
</p>
<h3>
Is there any way to know if it’s going to be
like that before you go into a job? 
</h3>
<div>
(transcribed
from audio, see appendix Audio 1) </div>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
That's a really hard thing to find out. But if you go out and speak
with previous employees or even graduates who were enrolled in one of
the programs, they might be able to tell you the ins and outs. It
basically depends on that. 
</p>
<p>
It's
your luck, but a safe way is to simply go about that is to find a job
at a start-up company or even a normal medium-scale company or
business that has less people, somewhere between 10 and 50 and then
work your way up amongst their ranks, try to become an intermediate
developer there. 
</p>
<p>
That's
what I was trying to do initially, but I ended up with another
start-up where the product hadn't been launched and it is a good
thing, a good place to learn and understand how the business is
working. But in reality, you don't want to stick with a company that
does not have a product out in the market. You need to be able to
have work or have a lot of your experience working on a product
that's in the market being used. You'll be able to get good salaries,
but in terms of your exposure, it's not really going to help you in
your career down the road.

<h3>
Tips for IT students  
</h3>
<div>
(paraphrased
from interviewer notes) 
</div>
<p>
When
making a side project, park it when you run out of momentum or
knowledge and then come back to it with the next set of skills. The
more you can document it, the easier it is to include any time as
part of a portfolio to show employers. You can use such things as a
blog post about how it works or, even better, a comprehensive GitHub
readme with installation and deployment instructions. Even add small
bug reports in the form of open issues and new functionality. Don’t
necessarily add all of them at once but some small manageable ones
that show you are consistently working on it. 
</p>
<p>
For
building a full stack programmer set of skills it’s beneficial to
create lots of small applications based on different languages,
despite what other people and students think of them. For example,
PHP has a number of different frameworks that are drastically
different, and it is not useful to judge them all based on one.
Back-end focused apps are the way to start rather than front end
because that is where the majority of the business logic usually is.
Java and PHP are common business languages in Brisbane and helpful
for employment. Java is a longer learning curve but rewarding and PHP
is quicker. 
</p>
<h3>
Tips for the team IT project  
</h3>
<div>(paraphrased
  from interviewer notes) </div>
<p>
If
you have people in your team who can quickly code a prototype that is
a great thing and something to take advantage of. In one of the
university projects that I did as part of a team, we spent the
majority of the time figuring out how we would do it and documenting
what we were going to do but left the coding till very late. The
advantage of having something early is that you can all play around
with it, see how it works and doesn’t. You can also have something
more to show at the end if the final product is incomplete or has too
many bugs. You just have to be willing to accept a lot of the code
might not be useful in the final product, which will probably be
started completely separately. 
</p>
<p>
On
the other hand, when you start working on the main codebase you want
to be able to progress steadily with the whole team on-board. The
downfall I had in that university project was that one guy said he’d
do all the coding for the back end and in the end it had so many bugs
and issues that we weren’t delivering a great product and it had
gone too far for us to fix. You want to be using tickets from
something like Jira or Twilio and then whoever codes it takes it out
of a branch with the name of the ticket then creates a pull request
that can be viewed, discussed and documented. You want to have
someone, or even two people, reviewing pull requests from the main
branch before merging and incorporating it and then possibly testing
it. When we did the project, it just ended up being me and this guy
committing huge chucks of code, smashing it together and creating a
big mess that got worse as it grew. You want to work like a team
would in a professional IT company with some structure and hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
When
you go for job interview you want to be able to show you know how to
work in a team like this. Even if you don’t know the language they
might be using on their product, you show that you can learn it and,
most importantly, that you know how to do this kind of teamwork. You
will even have the repo history to show it.
</p>
