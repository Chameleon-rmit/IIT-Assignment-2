  <h2>Individual Reflection</h2>
  <h3>Jarrad Elvey</h3>
  <p>
Something
that I was very conscious of was my dislike of working in groups
which would lead to me over-contributing. My assigned tasks were
Leadership, the Tools section, and the Website; and I think I
performed well at those tasks and didn’t over-contribute to other
tasks, allowing others to contribute their fair share. 
  </p>
  <p>
One
thing I was surprised at was how much I enjoyed working
collaboratively on the one shared document that I had (the
Introduction section). 
  </p>
  <p>
One
thing that could have been improved, both for the group and as part
of my responsibilities as the leader, was to get everyone on the same
page with regards to the tools and how we were using them (and get
confirmations from every team member) right at the start of the
assignment. 
  </p>
  <p>
Not
having worked much in larger groups one thing that I learned about
group work was how much leadership and communication activities
really take away from doing activities that will be in the final
report. 
  </p>
  <p>
Doing
group work has reaffirmed my preference for not doing group work.
Which isn’t that our group didn’t work well, it did, but the
“benefits” gained (of exposure to other ideas and less individual
work to do) didn’t outweigh the extra overhead required. 
  </p>
  <h3>David Egan</h3>
  <p>
Having
worked in groups for much of my working life I found this experience
quite different in that being wholly online it presented challenges
that I had not dealt with in the past. Not being able to meet in
person and having only the ability to communicate primarily via chat
and shared documents within MS Teams is an area that I feel I have
grown better in managing as the assignment has progressed. 
  </p>
  <p>
I
certainly feel that the group communicated clearly and concisely. All
team members were willing to listen to each other’s opinions and
took any feedback on board when producing text for the assignment.
Any larger decisions, such as choosing a team leader, were voted on
and Jarrad (our group leader) communicated well and kept the team on
path ensuring that all tasks were completed in a timely manner. 
  </p>
  <p>
This
experience for me has reminded me of how much I enjoy working with
and collaborating with others. For example, through Jarrad I learnt
better ways of structuring sentences and different grammatical uses.
The team showed me that online learning and working without
physically being near each other is not only possible, but can be
just as enjoyable, provided everyone is aware of expectations from
the beginning and manages their time appropriately. 
  </p>
  <h3>Ayub Khayre</h3>
  <p>
Being
a part of many teams, I found this to be a unique experience. I feel
as though our group did work well even though we were all working
remotely. We were quick to setup documents and assign tasks to
individuals to complete. Our team members were punctual for meetings
which added to a better collaborative effort. In some instances,
there were some disagreements our group carefully listened to all
opinions and voted on a solution.  
  </p>
  <p>
Although
this isn’t a major issue one thing that can be improved is the use
of multiple documents, at the beginning I did find it difficult
locating all documents, this was resolved quickly by creating an
assignment two folder. 
  </p>
  <p>
One
thing that did surprise me was the vast amount of knowledge in our
group. I was surprised to see that we had team members that worked in
different industries, for example Alexis has worked in the
Aeronautical field as a Pilot and Jonathan is currently working in
the medical field.  
  </p>
  <p>
From
the assignment I learnt that everyone has their own learning style
and processes, I also learnt that this is crucial in determining how
a group may or may not operate.  This experience has made me more
intrigued about the psychology of human learning and group dynamics. 
  </p>
  <h3>Alexis Satre</h3>
  <p>
I
found the group work quite energising and beneficial because you are
getting constant feedback rather than one set of feedback after an
assessment is marked. As we all could meet often this interaction was
great for my morale in the context of an online course that can be a
bit isolating. After meetings we could discuss random topics or
things that had come up in our other coursework, much like might
occur at an in-person workplace or university. Often there wasn’t
much scope to have these kinds of interactions elsewhere in the
course. 
  </p>
  <p>
What
I found worked well in our group was that we took the time early in
the project to develop a framework for how we were going to spend the
next weeks working together on the assignment. We used documents to
discuss the different merits of leadership models and group structure
and used spreadsheets to make group decisions on things like names
and meeting times. Our leader did a great job in setting up the
digital workspace by arranging meetings, setting up minutes and
action document templates. We also kept the pace of decisions and
taskings manageable for all group members so that we could all go
through the learning process together and reach consensus before
moving on. All team members were well aware of what was being done by
who and could assist each other easily by using the collaboration
tools in the Microsoft software suite. 
  </p>
  <p>
We
could probably improve our collaboration during the content writing
and work. Sometimes there were delays in giving each other feedback
and discussing topics. So in the next project we may decide to have
‘group work times’ where we work independently but online
together. This might also help productivity. 
  </p>
  <p>
I
learned that group work can often be slow and the administration of
it tedious but developing a good teamwork system means the work can
be effective and team can scale up easily to work on large tasks. 
  </p>
  <h3>Jonathan Seah</h3>
  <p>
Making
a formal group for projects is a first for me at a level past
secondary school.  While I had reservations about how well a group
could work for formal projects outside of work, the course project
went surprisingly well.   
  </p>
  <p>
All
members performed on their portions of work with a coordination that
still surprises me.  We collaborated on documents, pieced together
different portions of work and had seamless meetings with little
drama.   
  </p>
  <p>
The
usage of Teams and its interfacing with different technologies could
have been improved.  Some members had issues with overwriting
changes, which might have been solved with a proper version control
system, though such might be overkill for text projects.   
  </p>
  <p>
Other
interfacing difficulties involved duplication of work or desyncing
documents when replicated across multiple folders.  A better archival
process is needed to keep the current “live” document in a single
place.   
  </p>
  <p>
Overall,
the group work was productive despite the overhead costs of
coordination.

  <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
  <p>
At
the start of the assignment, as soon as the group was formed, we
created documents to gather input from our group members on how we
could best collaborate on the group work (<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/AD76BE05-4980-4B7B-A2BB-B25E9276E0C9?tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b&amp;fileType=docx&amp;objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Frmiteduau.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FSineNomine%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FGroup-work%20Design%20Document.docx&amp;baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Frmiteduau.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FSineNomine&amp;serviceName=teams&amp;threadId=19:9a63f437c02444f8bf32e9a7a5531ecc@thread.tacv2&amp;groupId=c939b413-2129-4047-9814-42661eadc5a4">Group-work
Design Document.docx</a>),
what the meeting format should be (<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/CB4C1EF7-C4FD-4642-8315-E2D694C624ED?tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b&amp;fileType=docx&amp;objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Frmiteduau.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FSineNomine%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FMeeting%20Format.docx&amp;baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Frmiteduau.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FSineNomine&amp;serviceName=teams&amp;threadId=19:9a63f437c02444f8bf32e9a7a5531ecc@thread.tacv2&amp;groupId=c939b413-2129-4047-9814-42661eadc5a4">Meeting
Format.docx</a>), and the initial splitting of the tasks
into assignable sections (<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/E1074CEA-2E56-42F3-8F14-FBB8A91AA079?tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b&amp;fileType=docx&amp;objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Frmiteduau.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FSineNomine%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FTasks%20Masterlist.docx&amp;baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Frmiteduau.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FSineNomine&amp;serviceName=teams&amp;threadId=19:9a63f437c02444f8bf32e9a7a5531ecc@thread.tacv2&amp;groupId=c939b413-2129-4047-9814-42661eadc5a4">Tasks
Masterlist.docx</a> - which has since evolved into the
main document that tracked our contributions). This worked well as it
helped to focus the group and get an initial indication for how we
would work together. 
  </p>
  <p>
An
area that our group could improve upon for future assignments is
ensuring that all team members are working to the same expectation
with agreed tools. As an example, our group determined that the use
of an online tool, mybib, for the management of references, as well
as taking advantage of file sharing within MS Teams would be
beneficial. In using these tools however, we did not set any rules
for their use which saw team members either not accessing specific
shared files early on causing some confusion, and references in mybib
not initially shared or mixed with other section’s references. By
setting expectations on how we will use tools it will help make the
team more productive and efficient. 
  </p>
  <p>
While
standardization of tools across the group and some rules to prevent
duplication of documents causing confusion might solve our
coordination problems, the overhead costs of such rules and necessary
work to prepare each person’s working environment may outweigh the
difficulties caused.  In this project, we had one or two documents
needing merging for conflicting changes and one person’s
contribution being overwritten; this only required a small amount of
error correction and resolving the confusion in the team meetings. 
Costs to mitigate these issues should be weighed against the benefits
of doing so.  A larger team size and longer or greater project scope
might justify formal measures against such coordination issues 
  </p>
  <p>
We
learned how to collaborate as a group. By using the shared documents,
we could all write in the same document at the same time/almost
seamlessly because of the autosave feature and the fast data
connection enabled by the Microsoft cloud applications. We could add
comments on each other’s work and use them to mark areas that still
needed attention. In our final report document, the person
responsible for the composition could use the track-changes feature
and comments to keep an eye on changes that any other team members
made. We also found the overhead of coordination to be higher than we
expected. Regularly communicating our ideas and progress was onerous,
especially in contrast to individual work where all one needs to do
is organise their own thoughts and planning. This overhead was made
easier by the team keeping communication succinct (although meetings
were often relaxed and often went slightly overtime) and writing
clear notes in the meeting agenda/minutes. The team members also made
things easier by being responsive to group messages and being
involved in the general working discussions on the main group chat. 
  </p>
  <p>
While
there were more and less proactive members in our group everyone was
involved enough that it is fair to say that we all contributed
equally to the assignment.
