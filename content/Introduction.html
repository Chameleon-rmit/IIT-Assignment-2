This report (and website) is for Assignment Two of RMITâ€™s Introduction to Information Technology (in Study Period Four of 2020). The assignment calls for several sections ranging from information about our team (both individually and collectively), to information on several aspects of the IT industry, to our reflection on our team and on aspects of the IT industry. One of the more important sections is describing in detail an IT Project that our team has chosen that will be realised (at least in part) in later assignments in this course.  </p>
<p>
The project that our team chose is a simple idea that will save time for people who write reports that feature a lot of reused sentence fragments (doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, and anyone who potentially writes reports on mobile devices). The most appropriate technology to use for the prototype, and perhaps even the finished product, is a Progressive Web Application, which we have addressed within this report.  </p>
<p>
Our project being a Progressive Web Application has had a direct influence upon the website portion of this assignment. There is not any prescription in the requirements of the assignment as to what the website needs to be (other than that it must contain the same content as the report). As such that portion of the assignment is also in the form of a Progressive Web Application to further emphasise how our project design could work and to begin to gain experience towards creating applications of that type. </p>
<p>
In completing this assignment, we split the required content into smaller tasks, assigning these tasks among the group in line with our individual strengths, skills and Assignment 1 feedback. This also helped to ensure that there was equal contribution among the team which is discussed further within the Tools section of this report. This enabled all group members to have an active role in all aspects of the assignment and to gain further experience working together as a team. </p>
