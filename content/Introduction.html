<p>This report (and website) is for Assignment Two of RMIT’s Introduction to
  Information Technology (in Study Period Four of 2020). The Assignment
  calls for several sections ranging from information about our team
  (both individually and collectively) to information on several
  aspects of the IT industry to our reflection on our team and on
  aspects of the IT industry. One of the more important sections is
  describing in detail an IT Project that our team has chosen that will
  be realised (at least in part) in later Assignments in this course.</p>
<p>The project that our team chose is a simple idea that will save time for
  people who write reports that feature a lot of reused sentence
  fragments (doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, and really
  anyone who potentially writes reports on mobile devices). The most
  appropriate technology to use for the prototype, and perhaps even the
  finished product, is a Progressive Web Application.</p>
<p>Our project being a Progressive Web Application has had a direct
  influence upon the website portion of this Assignment. There isn’t
  any prescription in the requirements of the Assignment as to what the
  website needs to be (other than that it must contain the same content
  as the report). As such we have decided to do a Progressive Web Application for that portion.</p>
