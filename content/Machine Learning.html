  <h2>What does it do?</h2>
  <p>
Machine
learning is a newly emerging field of computer science. The
well-known modern formulation uses neural networks to parse
information. This concept has been around since the 1970s but has not
seen prominence until the last decade as backpropagation /
reinforcement learning methods (Rumelhart, Hinton &amp; Williams
1986) were not feasible due to a lack of computer power.   
  </p>
  <p>
Recent
developments with deep learning and computer algorithms have allowed
relatively “simple” gradient descent training models to
outperform handcrafted AI models that were used in the past
(Schmidhuber 2015). This allowed AI methods like perceptrons,
generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and other
variations to be trained on large amounts of data provided their
structure allows the mathematical description of the network to be
differentiable.   
  </p>

  <p>
Perceptrons
can now perform image classification, for facial recognition, optical
character recognition and even video classification.   Recurrent
networks perform natural language and audio processing. Generative
adversarial networks can create images from seed data or even just a
description.   
  </p>
  <p>
In
2016, Deepmind’s AlphaGo program won a match of Go against one of
the world’s best players without handicaps, paralleling DeepBlue’s
victory over Kasparov in chess (Boroweic &amp; Lien 2016). The game
of Go requires viewing large areas of the board to determine the
value of moves, being infeasible for directly evaluating a game tree.
This was a demonstration of the progress perceptrons had made.   
  </p>
  <p>
Now
machine learning can perform simulations of computationally expensive
fluid flow (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2020) in real time, allowing
better and faster simulation of interactive environments for games
and for research. The greatest importance however is the ability of
the algorithm to generalize from simple training datasets to
complicated environments. Similar qualities were observed with the
AlphaGo program, later remade as AlphaZero to generalize to more than
just one type of game, indicating the potential for deep learning to
generalize out of its training data.   
  </p>
  <p>
Other
applications include detecting breast cancer (McKinney et al. 2020),
even to the level where machine learning algorithms can aid doctors
in improving false positive and false negative rates by five to ten
percent. The results are even generalizable from a training data
obtained in the UK to patients in the US. Similarly, work on
pneumonia detection in x-rays has achieved accuracy on par with
professionals within limited contexts (Rajpurkar et al. 2017),
pointing to a potential for machine learning algorithms to interpret
medical data.   
  </p>
  <p>
Along
the same lines, there is also work towards improving medical
diagnosis accuracies from overall patient data and not just in a
single domain (Razzaki et al. 2018).  While accuracy there does not
match medical professionals, there is still much development in the
field that could improve results.   
  </p>
  <p>
A
third application is controlling walking robots able to navigate
difficult terrain. In this example, a blind robot with only internal
sensors manages to navigate irregular terrain, snow, water and even
plants. This also generalizes to loads and crumbling terrain. Having
piloted test robots in the real world, the algorithm promises to
allow better locomotion for robots. Self-driving cars <i>(fig.
9)</i> are also a related field of work that is advancing
rapidly and the problem of transporting an object or person from one
place to another may well soon have an automated solution.

  <p>
These
advances have allowed automation to reach large quantities of data or
actions that were previously not feasible. Advertisers can now
classify vast quantities of usage data, video and picture sharing
websites can sweep through submissions with an artificial eye, and
even songs or speeches are available for parsing.

  <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
  <p>
These
developments show that machine learning has the potential to change
everything, being a fundamental improvement in automation. Any
problem that repeats itself, requires interpretation of data or a
feedback loop of sensory data to actions, is potentially solvable by
machine learning. As long as the desired behaviour can be trained in
an agent, machine learning can allow tools to automate the process.  
  </p>
  <p>
As
they say, this time is different. The machine learning powered
automation does not have to be better than humans, it just has to be
more cost efficient.  Computers are significantly cheaper than
people.  If a job is automatable, then it is likely that at some
point in the future, those jobs will be mostly automated. These range
from self-driving cars pushing out taxi or trucking services to
website article generation from prompts or video footage reducing
need for article writers. Jobs as far ranging as radiologists to
lawyers might well be affected by automation.   
  </p>
  <p>
The
taking over of existing tasks is not the only impact, however. The
extension of capabilities to parsing large quantities of data is
likely to open fields that were previously too expensive or too
difficult. This includes scientific research, like weather modelling
and protein folding (Senior et al. 2020), which may provide new tools
whose impact is hard to predict. What is likely is that the new tools
provided to researchers from machine learning will only increase the
speed of technological development. Machine learning has even reached
the levels of government policy and national security, with
predictive modelling of earthquakes to crop yields (Mignan &amp;
Broccardo 2019; van Klompenburg, Kassahun &amp; Catal 2020).   
  </p>
  <p>
Overall,
the impact of machine learning is to make our tools smarter and
applicable to more areas than just a narrow range of physically
simple tasks.   
  </p>

  <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
  <p>
For
an immediate impact on our personal lives, I would expect to see far
better computer graphics, including complicated light source
simulations (Zhang et al. 2020) or repainting scenes from photographs
(Martin-Brualla et al. 2020).  Videos and games become more
realistic, simulation and augmented reality become better and more
feasible.   
  </p>
  <p>
Machine
learning could also lead to improvements in healthcare outcomes,
better matching of products to consumers, jobs to jobseekers, or
possibly even government policy to outcomes (Zheng et al. 2020).   
  </p>
  <p>
Any
data driven process that is left to the machine learning algorithms
may well be able to personalize actions to the user on a category of
far greater resolution than any human driven system could.  We are
already seeing this process happen for internet advertising and their
consumer data, the same could happen for healthcare or other fields
too.   
  </p>
  <p>
As
machine learning technology matures over time, it promises to
increasingly apply automation to every aspect of work and life.  From
helper robots for the infirm to augmented reality applications, it is
hard to say where the limit might be.
