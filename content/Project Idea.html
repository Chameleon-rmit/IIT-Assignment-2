  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
You
can now quickly compose repetitive sentences with ease and speed.
  </p>
  <p>
RoboWrite
is a cross-platform application (app) that will create full sentences
based on selections from a user-defined form. The user can select
key-words to finish a sentence or even choose entire sentences. Each
template is fully customisable.
  </p>
  <p>
The
app automatically copies the results for the user to paste in another
app or document. However, the user can also view and modify results
and save or share it anywhere.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
Health
professionals, psychologists and physiotherapists write reports on
patients daily. These often follow the same structure,
resulting in hours of wasted writing time. Repeat sentences are
usually about the symptoms, appearance and progress of a patient. For
example: 
  </p>
  <h3>Physiotherapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The patient’s knee was extremely painful on <em>extension and walking</em>.</li>
    <li>The patient had <em>70%</em> range of motion.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Psychology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The patient looked <em>tired </em>and had <em>low energy</em>.</li>
    <li>Mr X appeared <em>well-groomed, prepared and rested</em>.</li>
    <li>His mood appeared <em>stable and moderate</em>.  His speech was <em>talkative and coherent.</em></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Radiology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There is <em>oedema</em> on the <em>tibial plateau</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Often
only one or two words will change in these types of sentences over
the different patients.
  </p>
  <p>
There
are no apps available to the public that can quickly automate
repetitive sentences and there is demand for a product like this
(Evan 2020, pers. conv., 11 December). 
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Potential User Base</h2>
  <p>
There
are over 25,000 members of Australian Psychology Association and
29,000 members of the equivalent Physiotherapy Association (APS 2021;
APA 2021). There are also approximately 20,000 practising counsellors
in Australia (Keast 2017). Medipeople (“Radiologist Salaries in
Australia &amp; New Zealand” 2018) estimates that over 2000
radiologists work in Australia, and with most radiologists making use
of competing technology (with voice recognition), this app will still
be useful if it provides superior customisation.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Threats</h2>
  <h3>Risks</h3>
  <p>
There
is a risk that after releasing the app, other companies may create
imitation products. Experienced developers could achieve this quickly
due to the simplicity of the app. It would be best to avoid this by
developing a <b>strong brand</b> with
adequate trademark protection and fostering a good relationship with
the user base. 
  </p>
  <h3>Competitors</h3>
  <p>
There
are currently no publicly available competitor products that the team
can find. 
  </p>
  <p>
There
is a Microsoft word extension used for marking within an Australian
University. (“Norfolk” 2021) It includes comment banks as a
feature, but it is private, so we are not able to assess it.
There
is at least one, and likely more, private radiology applications that
use voice recognition, discussed below.
It
would be desirable to <b>differentiate</b> this product
from voice recognition transcription applications, such as
radiologists use. This kind of software is prolific in various forms,
and there would be more consumer demand for a different niche. 
  </p>
  <h3>Existing Use Case</h3>
  <h4>Karisma</h4>
  <p>
Karisma
(<a href="https://www.kestral.com.au/solutions/karisma/">https://www.kestral.com.au/solutions/karisma/</a>)
is a Radiology Information System developed by Kestral Computing Pty
Ltd and is used by the Radiology department at the Royal Melbourne
Hospital to manage patient information in the department. The
application performs scheduling, tracks appointment information,
patient alerts, reports and accounting for payments.  
  </p>
  <p>
In
almost all workflows, Karisma provides a field for notes made against
various data entities (patients, services, letters, payments) which
allow a function known as Report Templates. These are a shortcut
combination that allow for quick pasting of a pre-defined and
formatted block of text into the currently open notes field.
Templates are used for radiologists to quickly insert formulaic
report content, for reception staff to insert appointment letter
content and for nursing staff to leave important medical alerts for
patients.
  </p>
  <h4>Example Workflow</h4>
  <img class="nondark" src="./images/karisma_1.png" />
  <div>(Figure 19: Karisma window used to create a Report template.)</div>
  <p>
Figure
19 above shows the Karisma
interface window in which a user might configure a template to be
used for later.  Example shown is a Protocol for a trauma scan.  
  </p>
  <img class="nondark" src="./images/karisma_2.png" />
  <div>(Figure 20: Invoking a template in a note field within Karisma)</div>
  <p>
Karisma
allows entering a partial match to the code, “pc.t” <i>(fig.
20),</i> followed by the hard coded shortcut combination
Crtl-Space that displays a list of all templates that match the code
given.  Typing “pc.t.T” would exclude the first entry from
selection.  
  </p>
  <img class="nondark" src="./images/karisma_3.png" />
  <div>(Figure 21: Inserted template in Karisma)</div>
  <p>
After
inserting the template <i>(fig.
4),</i> it becomes normal text that can be edited. Of note is
the wildcard field that has replaced the [Current Date/Time] with the
current date and time, and the [Security User Name] with the current
logged in user’s name.  
  </p>
  <h4>Flaws</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Limited to in-application use only. The function is built into Karisma and not available in other patient information systems, such as the hospital-wide systems like iPM and EPIC.  </li>
    <li>Templates are not shared between applications outside of Karisma; current existing problem in the department relates to Nursing staff being unable to use templates for notes in EPIC to record the same patient alerts; EPIC does not have a freeform templating system.</li>
    <li>Method to invoke templates are long and convoluted causing a potential training issue.</li>
    <li>Proliferation of many customized templates used by different staff; some radiologists utilise personally written templates customized for their own individual use causing difficulty in standardisation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>SWOT Analysis for RoboWrite</h2>
  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <p>
The
project can progress steadily from a minimal and manageable MVP
towards a more feature-rich product. There are no new technological
leaps required to create the app. It is merely automating a common
task.
Additional
strength is that team members could apply the learning experience
from creating this to similar text-based apps.
  </p>
  <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Simplicity:</i> It may be challenging to create a strong value proposition for customers because it is a straightforward app.</li>
    <li> <i>Speed:</i> The app must be very responsive and user friendly for users to benefit.  The app will not get strong adoption if it is slow or cumbersome in any way. Developers must minimise user actions to get the output to where it needs to go for the user. </li>
    <li> <i>Codebase:</i> As a consequence of its simplicity, it would be an out of proportion amount of effort to produce codebases for all possible platforms, especially without being sure what platforms users are likely to use at this stage. The team will avoid wasted effort by either focussing solely on one platform that is most likely to be used (Web or iPad) or spending a reasonable amount of time finding a means of delivering the app to as many devices as possible from the one codebase.</li>
    <li> <i>Security:</i> JavaScript projects that incorporate many technology layers are known to be more challenging to secure. Using a framework (or native app) would mean the project automatically gains the provider’s security features. This use would not absolve the team from security responsibility but would substantially reduce the time spent focussing on security in the early stages. (Ionic 2021)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Opportunities</h3>
  <p>
Future
funding and monetisation could come from:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
    <i>App sales:</i> Users ideally could try free for one week and then need to pay a once-off fee or small subscription. Mobile app store distributions incur high fees – 15% for Apple App store. (Leswing 2020)</li>
  <li> ‘<i>Freemium’</i><b> </b><i>purchases:</i> The app could require a purchase to unlock the open/save feature, allowing the user to experience the app before paying for the major feature. iCloud or similar sync could be a further paid feature.  </li>
  <li> <i>Licencing:</i> The team could licence desktop applications to services that bundle apps for subscription fees such as SetApp. Hospitals or centres might pay annual licencing fees if this allowed them to modify the app to suit them or pay for the further development of features they require.</li>
  <li> <i>Sponsorship:</i><b> </b>Professional organisations such as APA and APS mentioned above might sponsor development in return for member discounts.</li>
  <li> <i>Crowdfunding:</i> This would involve offering discounts to pre-purchase the software (or additional features) and probably require free and paid promotions through social media. By getting prospective users to pay in advance for specific features, we would get the most accurate information about the order of the features we should implement. Crowd-funding also increases awareness of the app from the regular viewers of a crowdsourcing platform. The main risk is that it will present poorly to the public if it fails to reach a funding goal. It is also uncertain if this campaign will reach enough buyers relative to the low cost of the app. (App Partner Academy 2018)</li>
  <li> <i>Donations:</i> Users would have an in-app option to donate money to develop the app, including future support and features. Developers could encourage users by displaying a discrete but persistent popup or toolbar until the user donates.</li>
  <li> <i>Open-source:</i> The team might continue development by harnessing other programmers’ volunteer time and interested people by making the app available on a public repository.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
The
app will be a basic three-page application that consists of:
  </p>
  <h3>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Setup page:</i><b> </b>A page where a user can set up the tick-boxes and the sentences to go with them. The user will type in the leading text for each tick-box series. It will also allow you to save the template or open others.</li>
    <li> <i>Tick-box page:</i> A page which allows the user to tick the relevant boxes in an easy-to-use format and clear the tick-boxes when done. It may be more user-friendly and attractive to use boxes, labels or buttons that can be selected or deselected, which also reduces the number of on-screen elements. </li>
    <li> <i>Output page:</i> A popup or page where the output text is displayed, and the user can save, share or export the text quickly to add elsewhere.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Further features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Save and open:</i><b> </b>Being able to save different templates would be a landmark feature in the development process. It would be highly desirable for a user as long as they can easily export results in the meantime. Being able to save to device or server would mean it would be a much more attractive product because users could have templates and organisations such as hospitals or centres could store the data and provide standardised templates</li>
    <li> <i>Cloud sync:</i> The user could easily swap between devices. For example, making the selections on an iPad and then changing to the desktop app to export the results. Alternatively, a user might want to use different devices at different workplaces.</li>
    <li> <i>Adaptive layout:</i><b> </b>In the event the user chooses to create whole sentences to select, the <em>Setup page</em> will need to allow these sentences to stack clearly on top of each other and the <em>Tick-box</em><b> </b><em>page</em> will need to allow at least a few of the words of each sentence to be visible, possibly the whole sentence. The team will need to put effort into an adaptive layout to account for the variety of possible setups and also different device sizes.</li>
    <li> <i>Sentence logic:</i><b> </b>Saving files may allow users to create different templates for different situations. However, the app may also need to display certain sentences based on the selections made in earlier sentences by creating an additional input area on the <em>Setup page. </em>It would be a simple input where the user writes the keyword(s) that the sentence is contingent upon. It would remain hidden until those words are used in the <em>Tick-box </em>page. </li>
    <li><i>Hotkeys and Background Operation:</i>Making the program work in the background (or with a floating window) that intercepts user-defined hotkeys before pasting the text into the current text field of the user’s active window.  This would allow the user to make use of templates in other programs without having to switch between our application and the target programs. This function would be very beneficial in highly repetitive tasks.  </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Other design notes</h3>
  <p>
It
may be possible to make it a single page application and use modals
for the Setup page and the Output page.

</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Tool Selection</h2>
  <p>
Tool
selection is a significant decision that can affect the project far
into the future. The team cannot easily predict the difficulty in
coding design and features in advance without a broad knowledge of
the tools available. 
  </p>
  <img class="nondark" src="./images/tech_stack.gif" />
  <p>
Considerations
include
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>skills of the available team</li>
    <li>learning curves</li>
    <li>the size of the community and learning resources available</li>
    <li>maintainability</li>
    <li>security (this is less a concern at the early stages)</li>
    <li>testing and auditing</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Web App</h3>
  <p>
Using
a standard client-side web stack of HTML/CSS/JavaScript is the most
obvious option (Oragui 2018). The team could expand this to using
NodeJS and MongoDB server-side, using JavaScript (Suschevich 2020).
It would require the least amount of new language or syntax learning
to be done by the team. However, it would likely be time-consuming
for some members to learn how to manage state, transitions between
pages and make elements look appealing and adaptive. It would also be
possible to adapt this web code to install on mobile devices (using
wrappers such as Capacitor and Cordova) making it a Hybrid App (“What
is Capacitor?” 2018).
However,
users must find the app intuitive and easy to navigate based on their
experience with other apps. Using a framework (such as React or
Ionic) or at least a library such as Bootstrap, would reliably
provide this familiar appearance and behaviour (Ovchinnikova 2020). 
  </p>
  <h3>Ionic</h3>
  <p>
One
stand-out tool for rapid development would be the cross-platform
programming system Ionic (Ionic 2020), which leverages HTML and
Javascript web technologies, making it adaptable and quicker to
learn. The code used in an ionic page is easily recognisable to a Web
Developer.
The
team can then use this single codebase to build the app for iOS,
Android, web, desktop or any other platform where the web
runs <em>(“Ionic Article: Comparing
Cross-Platform Frameworks” 2019). </em>Although it is
not native code and runs as a web view in iOS, an Ionic application
can also use native level protocols such as identity management or
the camera.
  </p>
  <p>
Ionic
comes in two parts. One is a set of UI components that can be used,
including the JavaScript libraries on the page that you are writing
in ionic-style code. The second part is the CLI which is more of a
platform. It sets up the project folder/file hierarchy and can run as
a server to serve the web app. Ionic also uses Capacitor to compile
the hybrid app to be installed on non-web platforms. (“What is
Capacitor?” 2018)
  </p>
  <h3>Ionic Libraries</h3>
  <p>
Developers
can use Ionic with several different front-end component libraries
and frameworks. These are all built on JavaScript, HTML and CSS, so
share some commonality. (Ionic 2020)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vue</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>StencilJS (or plain JavaScript)</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Of
these options JS (JavaScript) is the most ubiquitous and would
require the least new language learning on the part of those in the
team coding the app. On the other hand, there is significantly more
free learning material to be found online for React and Angular when
used within an ionic project. Angular is popular but has regular
breaking changes to the framework as it is upgraded and there have
already been successive versions 1,2 and 3 (Rodriguez &amp; Bell
2017). React is also a strong option and can be slowly migrated to
from JavaScript.
It
is possible to: 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>start coding in Ionic with a basic web app (does not require compiling, uses CDN (Content Delivery Network) for elements)</li>
    <li>add react components if needed or as learnt </li>
    <li>use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and Ionic-CLI (Command Line Interface) to compile an app for iOS and android</li>
    <li>incorporate testing and CI (continuous integration)</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>React</h3>
  <p>
<i><em>React is an
open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user
interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
community of individual developers and companies. </em>(“React
– A JavaScript library for building user interfaces” 2021). </i>
  </p>
  <p>
The
main strength of React is that you can make attractive web
applications without spending time thinking about and writing the
HTML and CSS code required for formatting and appearance. It also can
handle the functionality of the website. The main drawback is the
learning time required beyond the basic web stack as it has a unique
syntax.
  </p>
  <h3>React Native</h3>
  <p>
<i><em>React Native utilises the JS framework
React, but renders native UI elements at runtime, allowing you to
build iOS and Android apps.</em><em> (“Ionic
Article: Comparing Cross-Platform Frameworks” 2019)</em></i>
  </p>
  <p>
React
Native is a prevalent tool for creating cross-platform apps. However,
it can require slightly different code bases for each platform
(“React Native Vs Ionic: Detailed Comparison 2020” 2021). One
advantage is that developers can translate it from React easily, so
the team could start developing a react web app and then progress to
a react native app for mobile devices. It is not clear how much
rewriting would be necessary, although it should be minimal as the
bulk of this app idea involves the user interface; the app will
require only a few platform-specific APIs and protocols.
  </p>
  <h3>iOS Native (XCode/Swift)</h3>
  <p>
It
might be possible for the team to learn Xcode programming and release
it only on Mac (“Apple Developer: Mac Catalyst” 2021), iPad and
iOS. However, from personal experience, Apple’s XCode (IDE) and
Swift (language) can present steep learning curves for new
developers. The language is unique, strictly typed and has evolved
significantly in recent years (meaning online examples are sometimes
unreliable). XCode can be painful to navigate. Debugging, deployment
and testing errors can be challenging without experience.
Furthermore, this approach requires developers to install XCode and
device simulators, often meaning they need a Mac computer.
However,
the advantage is that the team could focus on one ecosystem and
produce succinct code for a fast and seamless app experience.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Decision</h2>
  <p>
The
team prefers to build a prototype with a minimum amount of tooling
lock-in. Writing a web page in pure JavaScript (with Ionic for UI
enhancements) gives a wide amount of options to progress the
application. It will still be efficient and fast to code an MVP given
the existing web stack skills of the team. Once past the prototype
stage, we can switch to a dedicated framework. After the basic
functionality is implemented, refactoring part of the code using a
different paradigm should be possible in a reasonable amount of time.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Version Control</h2>
  <p>
Git
would be used for version control and the repository hosted on
GitHub. This is standard among modern app developers and there are a
number of strong free alternatives if there are any issues
encountered (van Gumster 2018; Atlassian 2019). Our team is also
encouraged to use a GUI for git version control awareness. GitKraken
is an excellent multi-platform option (“Free Git GUI Client -
Windows, Mac &amp; Linux | GitKraken” 2019). 
  </p>
</div>
<img src="./images/robowrite_featuremap.gif" />
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Testing and Integration</h2>
  <p>
Cypress
is a simple but effective testing tool for web platforms. It uses
JavaScript code to set up which is already known by members of the
team. It can be used as part of Continuous Integration if that is
needed in later development (“JavaScript End to End Testing
Framework” 2021).
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Prototyping</h2>
  <p>
InVision
Studio is free for 1 project. (“Plans &amp; Pricing” 2021). It
has a good reputation among User Interface designers and should work.
Figma (“A Free, Online Wireframing Tool to Help You Communicate
Your Design” 2021) also offers a simple wireframing tool for free
that could precede and possibly cover prototyping. Either software
suite could be used with no significant disadvantages. Rough sketches
will be the first stage of prototyping and, because the project is
simple, may even be sufficient for MVP prototyping.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Skills and Feasibility</h2>
  <p>
Programming
skills for development and testing are the main requirement, but
other skills will allow the app to take form more effectively.
Prototyping and user outreach may prevent unnecessary code changes
and provide an initial deliverable. Design and presentation skills
could help create awareness of the product and advertise it well on a
website and the various app stores. The biggest obstacle is likely
going to be having to learn app development skills and potentially
spending time on this rather than producing a product or alternative
deliverable. However, this would be very easy to access, given the
number of free or cheap online courses for Ionic development (Grimm
2020; Moroney 2020). Therefore, learning this is entirely possible in
less than 10 hours. Also, there would be no need for external
database usage in the Minimum Viable Product; the state and saved
templates could be kept on the user's device.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Maintanability</h2>
  <p>
The
advantage of focussing on the standard we stack with Ionic components
means that the languages used are unlikely to change quickly. This
means there is less likelihood of coders needing to review the
codebase and update it according to language changes or framework
updates. The code most likely to need updating is the react
components if they are used.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content_box">
  <h2>Outcome (MVP)</h2>
  <p>
A
successful app would allow many professionals to save work hours at a
small cost and help improve the world. Professionals will be able to
record the standard information more quickly and instead focus on the
primary purpose of the appointment. However, even as a prototype,
customer engagement and specification would allow development to
continue at a later stage if found to be viable.
  </p>
</div>
