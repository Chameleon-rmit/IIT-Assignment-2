  <h2>What does it do?</h2>
  <p>
Blockchain
technology offers many different opportunities to people,
organisations and governments, but, fundamentally, it is an
immutable sequential ledger of any data type, protected
from tampering by a combination of encryption and (in the case of
public blockchains) economics.  
  </p>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
Bitcoin
was somewhat of a cultural reaction to the general
expansion of crony-capitalism in western society and
the ever-increasing surveillance and control of governments
over citizens. The 2008 financial crisis, in particular, brought
this starkly into focus for all citizens of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
The Cypherpunks were an international
group of liberal and often libertarian computer and cryptography
enthusiasts from around the world who communicated on the
internet. Along with many other citizens and
organisations, they viewed the unethical lending, trading
and government bailouts as criminal theft of money from the citizens
by their governments and financial corporations. They also found the
government's fractional banking systems and the government's
financial instruments to be unethical and unbeholden to the citizens
they should serve. (“Anticapitalism and
the Cypherpunk Movement – Subverter” 2017).

  <p>
Cypherpunks also
saw a great need for privacy in the modern, global, and
interconnected world. This is reflected in the following
quote, <i>“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the
electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something
one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is
something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to
selectively reveal oneself to the world.”</i> (Hughes 1993).
  </p>
  <p>
This
niche and underground social movement led to the creation
of Bitcoin in 2008, the very same year that banks were being
bailed out by governments around the world (“The Cypherpunk Movement”
2019).
  </p>
  <p>
This whitepaper (authoritative report) and
first transactions were made by the pseudonym Satoshi
Nakamoto leading to the world having its first
true digital currency, which is completely untethered
from any currency reserve or physical assets. It is also completely
independent from governments or corporations. Bitcoin drew on
previous technology from digital currencies, cryptography and the
‘Cypherpunk’ movement, however, Nakamoto made a revolutionary
step and drew all these ideas together in a powerful, coherent
creation (Nakamoto 2008).  The value of Bitcoin and contemporary
competitors have significantly exploded since the creation of this
currency. Today, crypto currencies are a part of the global
vocabulary and are considered by leading institutions a financial
asset class in their own right. 
  </p>
  <h3>Independence</h3>
  <p>
Inflation
and monetary expansion reduce the wealth of individuals who use a
currency. Bitcoin, in contrast to fiat (dollar) currency, cannot be
printed, issued, or debased by any central authority and therefore it
cannot be artificially inflated as it is entirely decentralised.
Meaning it operates on the consensus of all the nodes (people or
organisations) participating (Song 2020).
  </p>
  <h3>Diversity of features</h3>
  <p>
Subsequent
blockchains have added different features or behaviour by changing
the fundamental algorithms that run and secure a blockchain.
Blockchains can now operate in almost any sector. Although it isn’t
completely integrated there is promise in healthcare, logistics, art
dealing, capital raisings, democratic systems and financial
technology. It has only been made possible by the advancement of
modern public-key encryption, economics, and computing
technology.
  </p>
  <h3>Mathematical trust</h3>
  <p>
Blockchain
products are advantageous because they require minimal agreement and
trust between parties other than the algorithms and math that
underlie the technology. There is no way bitcoin can be counterfeited
and it is extremely difficult to reverse any transaction or
‘double-spend’ bitcoin. Additionally, there is less need for long
term trust-building between institutions before they are willing to
transact across borders with social and legal differences.
Blockchains cannot be debased or artificially inflated to benefit
specific industries during international trade. There is almost no
way for instability such as government upheaval or criminal actions
to undermine the integrity of a blockchain.

  <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
  <img src="./images/blockchain_swot.png" />
  <div>(Figure 17: SWOT for Blockchain by Upadhayaya, Sharma &amp; Arun 2017, p. 12)</div>
  <p>
Blockchain
currencies have the potential to become a major
technological tool in many industries.  
  </p>
  <h3>Organisational Transparency</h3>
  <p>
Record
keeping and auditing will be streamlined and all changes to data
will be recorded. This could dramatically reduce the likelihood
of embezzlement from companies and governments if they
chose to secure their funds and record keeping with blockchain
technology. 
  </p>
  <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
  <p>
Creating
commercial digital agreements (smart contracts) within a blockchain
means less need for costly risk reduction measures like financial
intermediaries, escrow accounts and arbitration. Smart contracts can
also require a confirmation from multiple parties to complete
transactions. 
  </p>
  <h3>Micro-scaling Finance Products</h3>
  <p>
Any
person requiring the smallest of transactions can use blockchain.
Blockchain can offer substantial cost savings and, therefore,
entrepreneurial opportunity, to companies or people who would
typically operate transactions on a scale too small for existing
financial institutions to work without huge fees (Upadhayaya,
Sharma &amp; Arun 2017, p. 92).
Western
Union money transfers is a typical example of this
as it is incredibly costly for individuals to send money to
relatives worldwide because each customer cannot coordinate with
other customers to reach a scale large enough to either negotiate or
find competition. Blockchain avoids the need to coordinate and even
use such financial products as it is international by default. Each
user only needs to concern themselves with converting blockchain
currencies to and from the local currency. 
  </p>
  <p>
Millions
of people worldwide have no access to personal banking but have
access to a smartphone. Blockchain offers the possibility of enabling
these people to participate in their economies in ways previously
impossible. They could take loans, save money securely, prove their
identity and own property without the onerous bureaucratic banking
and government systems that are often corrupt and too time-consuming
in developing nations. (Hernando
De Soto, Hudson &amp; For 2001) 
  </p>
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>
People
can use a blockchain to store any data that they wish to make public
and permanent. It can also store encrypted or sensitive
data. Whistle-blowers could share leaks directly to the
blockchain, making their leaks immutable and public at the same
time. 
  </p>
  <h3>Providence</h3>
  <p>
Blockchains
can also include a series of signatures that proves who has possessed
or transferred a physical product of any kind.

  <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
  <p>
The
rise of blockchain will not
only affect myself but also the greater global economy, I
believe that this will affect: 
  </p>
  <img class="nondark" src="./images/blockchain_health.gif" />
  <h3>My identity and personal records</h3>
  <p>
With
the anonymity that blockchain provides I will have greater
control over my identity and personal data. Everything
from driving licences, registration, medical records, rental
records, references could be stored securely and encrypted on the
blockchain in a way that the I could control. 
  </p>
  <h3>How my Healthcare information is stored</h3>
  <p>
With
the secure encryption that blockchain provides, I believe I can
securely share my healthcare information with
organisations, for an example of this please refer to the following
diagram: 
  </p>
  <h3>My Personal Banking</h3>
  <p>
As
previously discussed, personal banking may become dramatically
different as we become used to holding different currencies, creating
smart contracts, or actioning international transfers without so much
as a second though. We may be able to access a market of different
loan providers at our fingertips. These providers could then access
an anonymised summary of all our financial records instantly when we
apply for a loan.
