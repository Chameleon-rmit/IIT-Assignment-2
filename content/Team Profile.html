  <div>(Table 2: 16 Personalities Results)</div>
  <p>
As
displayed in Table 2, forty percent of our group members have the
personality type advocate, the advantage of having advocates in a
group situation is advantageous as they can “make nearly any
position work” (NERIS Analytics Limited,
2013a) Having a high percentage of individuals than can work
in any positions can be extremely beneficial in a group scenario.
This reduces conflict when it comes to assigning groups roles and
tasks. The conflict adverse nature of advocates can sometimes be
considered as a disadvantage having individuals that are reluctant to
voice their opinion may result in some issues, therefore it is
important that decisions are made as a group using methods as group
voting and decision making (Truity, 2019).
  </p>
  <p>
Group
SEEKS contains two members with the Logician Personality type, unlike
the advocate personality type logicians “logician personalities
prefer to work alone” (16Personalities,
n.d.). As the name of the personality type hints, logicians
are very logical in nature, they can break down complex issues into
smaller pieces and have analytical skills that can be used to make a
team better. It is beneficial to have logicians in a group as they
can assist with problem solving, however their introverted and do it
yourself personality type may be an obstacle when it comes to
communication. Therefore, it is important to have follow up meetings
to ensure that there is clear communication in a group environment.
  </p>
  <p>
The
team leader of group SEEKS has the architect personality type.
“Architects are known for their independence” and will find it
difficult to work under a “Micro-managing” boss (16Personalities,
n.d.).  As independence is very important for the Architect
personality type it is often difficulty for them to work in a group
environment as they find it difficult to depend on individuals. This
personality type often disregards hierarchies. This can be extremely
beneficial in an agile environment; however, this may not be an
advantage depending on the type of personalities in a group. This is
because some individuals prefer to work in set structures and
hierarchies (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2013).
  </p>
  <p>
The
information detailed above may be helpful for our group members as it
provides some insight on the individuals in our groups and how to
best interact with them. With the right leader knowing one’s
likelihood of behaviour in a workplace or group dynamic can result in
proactiveness and a positive group experience.

  <img src="./images/learning_style_test.gif" />
  <div>(Table 3: Learning Styles Results)</div>
  <p>
From
our results from the Learning Styles test the most dominant style for
our group was the visual learning style (43.40% Visual learners).
Meaning team SEEKS will need to implement visual learning methods
such as drawing out diagrams using colours and writing down key words
and information. Visual learners “prefer reading a story rather
than listening to it” (Study.com, n.d.)
and “Learn from seeing things written out” (Study.com,
n.d.). This makes sense as our team scored the lowest for the
learning style auditory. In order to succeed team SEEKS will need to
utilise required documentation such as their weekly actions and
agendas. The information from the Learning Styles test may be helpful
as it assists us in determining our teams most dominant learning
style. This will then enable us to implement the learning techniques
that work to our strengths. 
  </p>
  <img src="./images/enneagram_test.gif" />
  <div>(Table 4: Enneagram Results)</div>
  <p>
The
Enneagram test delves into “how people interpret the world and
manage their emotions” (Truity, 2020).
The test contains nine personality types that are defined by a core
belief.
  </p>
  <p>
As
displayed in the table above our teams most common personality type
was Type 5 which was closely followed by Type 1. From the website
<a href="https://www.truity.com/">https://www.truity.com/</a>
individuals with the personality Type 5 are said to “seek
understanding and knowledge and are more comfortable with data than
people” (Truity,
2020).  Whereas people with the
Personality Type 1 “place a lot of emphasis on following the rules
and doing things correctly” (Truity,
2020). Type five directly
correlates with the logician personality from the 16 personalities
test. This test reinforces that our group consists of logical
thinkers, like the personality test it may take some time for group
members to be comfortable with one another. With this in mind, our
team will need to set proactive goals for group members to ensure
that the completion of the assignment is on schedule. This type of
organisation can provide some piece of mind to team members, building
trust along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
The
information gathered from the Enneagram test is especially helpful as
it outlines the most dominant beliefs for our group and provides us
with the insight that we are a data driven team which will focus on
completing tasks correctly.
