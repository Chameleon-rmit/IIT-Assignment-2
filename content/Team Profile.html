  <span class="image_subtext">(Graph 1.1 MBTI results)</span>
  <p>
As
displayed in Graph 1.1, two of our group members have the personality
type advocate, the advantage of having advocates in a group situation
is advantageous as they always “find ways to make nearly any
position work” (Workplace Habits |
Advocate (INFJ) Personality | 16Personalities, 2021). In a group
dynamic Advocates “gravitate toward managers who are open-minded&quot;
(Workplace Habits | Advocate (INFJ) Personality | 16Personalities,
2021), therefore it is important that the individual and managers
morals align. 
  </p>
  <p>
Group
SEEKS contains three members with the Logician Personality type, unlike
the advocate personality type logicians “logician personalities
prefer to work alone” (Workplace Habits | Logician (INTP)
Personality | 16Personalities, 2021) and can view their colleagues as
“a series of obstacles” (Workplace Habits | Logician (INTP). 
Although logicians can be tolerant as leaders, they “do best with a
partner” (Workplace Habits | Logician (INTP).
  </p>
  <p>
The
information detailed above may be helpful for our group members as it
provides some insight on the individuals in our groups and how to
best interact with them. With the right leader knowing ones’
likelihood of behavior in a workplace or group dynamic can result in
a positive group experience.
  </p>
  <br />
  <img src="./images/ideal_jobs_image1.png" alt="Learning Styles Results" /><br />
  <span class="image_subtext">(Graph 1.2 Learning Styles results)</span>
  <p>
From
our results from the Learning Styles test the most dominant style for
our group was the visual learning style (43.40% Visual
learners). Meaning team SEEKS will need to implement visual learning
methods such as drawing out diagrams using colors and writing down
key words and information. Visual learners “prefer reading a story
rather than listening to it” (2021)
and “Learn from seeing things written out” (2021).
This makes sense as our team scored the lowest for the learning style
auditory.
  </p>
  <p>
The information
from the Learning Styles test may be helpful as
it assists us in determining our teams most dominant learning style.
This will then enable us to implement the learning techniques that
work to our strengths. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
The
Enneagram test delves into “how people interpret the world and
manage their emotions” (What is the Enneagram of Personality?,
2021). The test contains nine personality types that are defined by a
“particular core belief about how the world works” (What is the
Enneagram of Personality?, 2021).
  </p>
  <p>
As
displayed in the table above our teams’ most common personality
type was Type 5 which was closely followed by Type 1. From the
website <a href="https://www.truity.com/">https://www.truity.com/</a>
individuals with the personality Type 5 are said to “seek
understanding and knowledge and are more comfortable with data than
people”
(The 9 Types of the Enneagram, 2021).
 Whereas people with the Personality Type 1“place a lot of emphasis
on following the rules and doing things correctly” (The
9 Types of the Enneagram, 2021).
  </p>
  <p>
This
information is especially helpful as it outlines the most dominant
beliefs for our groups and provides with the insight that we are a
data driven team which will focus on completing tasks correctly.
