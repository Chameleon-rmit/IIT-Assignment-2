  <h2>What does it do?</h2>

  <p>
Virtual
Reality (VR), the ability to experience a virtual world, has a rich
history which has come a long way from early visions. In the 1830’s
Sir Charles Wheatstone, after conducting research into binocular
vision, created the Stereoscope, allowing the viewing of two images
(one for each eye) taken from different angles, giving a
3-dimensional (3D) effect when viewed with his invention. It would be
almost 130 years later that cinematographer Morton Heilig would
create what is considered the first VR machine, the Sensorama in 1956
<i>(fig. 13)</i>. This
device built upon Sir Charles Wheatstone’s research and used
cutting edge technologies (for the time) to create an experience that
combined audio, 3D video, vibrations, and even smell to create what
he called the “cinema of the future” (Barnard 2018).
  </p>
  <p>
It would take another 60 years after the Sensorama before VR
would start to truly become a technology that you could use in our
own home. In fact, the term ‘Virtual Reality’, was not coined
until 1987 by programmer Jaron Lanier (Barnard 2018).

  <p>
The VR we use today is much smaller than Heilig’s device
(thankfully), and consists of a headset, either stand-alone, attached
to a computer or even to a PlayStation console and will typically
include controllers used to track movement <i>(fig.
14)</i>. The headset is able to track a user’s head
movements to help convince the brain it really is in another
‘virtual’ place. This is achieved by displaying immersive 3D
images through the headset to each eye from different perspectives,
just like Sir Charles Wheatstone was able to demonstrate in 1838, and
takes this further by enabling a 360-degree view.

  <p>
Some
current applications of VR include Psychologists helping their
patients to overcome phobias, such as fear of heights, by letting
them experience and overcome their fear without risk to their safety
(Mihai Andrei 2019). Melbourne Water, a company that admittedly does
not first come to mind when thinking about VR technologies, is
employing VR to help train staff in a safe virtual environment.
Working closely with Deakin University, they co-created the world’s
first VR training program for snakebite prevention and first-aid
training. (Cooper 2019; Melbourne Water n.d.). 
  </p>
  <p>
One
of the top adopters of VR technology has been the healthcare training
industry with a forecasted revenue of $2.4 billion by 2026, up from
$216 million in 2018 (Marbury 2020). One of the primary uses of VR
within this industry is for surgery simulation which allows for the
recreation of an operating room in a virtual space, providing
surgeons a safe environment to gain skills and competence levels. You
can view an example of how this works in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llm-gz_-DYc">this
video</a> (2 min) from <a href="https://virtualmedicalcoaching.com/">virtualmedicalcoaching.com</a>
which shows a student practicing radiography in a safe virtual space.
They can also simulate emergencies such as accidents involving
multiple patients or disease outbreaks (ScienceSoft 2020).
  </p>
  <p>
One
way in which we are likely to see VR change over the next several
years is the continued blurring of lines between technologies into
what is being called Extended reality, or XR for short. XR involves a
combination of Mixed reality (26%), Augmented reality (36%) and
Virtual reality (38%) to achieve such a realistic virtual space that
incorporates the real world in such a way as to be seamless enough
that you cannot tell the difference. Augmented reality (AR) relies
upon a device, such as a phone and overlays synthetic content over
what the camera is seeing. Mixed reality (MR) enables the blending of
AR and VR enabling both physical and virtual elements that can be
interacted with. XR takes these technologies further by bringing all
these tools together, as well as utilising all future reality
technologies. XR seeks to create a reality where you can suspend
disbelief and believe you are truly in a virtual environment,
referred to as the holy grail of VR (Rogers 2017). Frontiers in
Virtual Reality (2020) describe XR as an ‘… enhanced visual
realism that is increasingly facilitated by stereoscopic vision, head
tracking and eye tracking to attain synchronization with the person's
eye movements … ’.
  </p>
  <p>
XR
technologies are being made possible by advances in tech such as 5G
with its high bandwidth and low latency, artificial intelligence and
machine learning (see <a href="#_Machine_Learning">Machine
Learning</a>) and of course AR and VR (Greig 2020;
Scribani 2019). The low price of these technologies is also enabling
students to begin experimenting earlier and earlier, with an average
price of an Oculus Quest at around AU$479
(<a href="https://www.oculus.com/compare/">https://www.oculus.com/compare/</a>).
In an interview with Medical Futurist (2019), VR expert Robert Scoble
believes that over the next few years we are likely to see workers
within many industries take advantage of these technologies. The
medical industry is likely to be highly impacted, with doctors being
able to setup a diagnosis while enjoying a coffee at their local
café, all while looking at virtual screens with their patient’s
data. In fact, this is being made a reality with products such as
Vodafone's new augmented and mixed reality glasses (Geary 2020).
Vodafone says that this technology, which is already available,
allows you to “ … seamlessly blend real-world and digital content
while you interact with virtual 3D objects … ”.

  <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
  <p>
The
impact XR will have within industry will be far reaching and will
change how we communicate, how we work and how we experience the
world. With XR potentially allowing us to taste and smell in a
virtual world (Marr 2020) this will only be the beginning. 
  </p>

  <div>(Figure 15: Top industry use for XR (Scribani 2019))</div>
  <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
  <p>
XR will start to see wide use in product design, a place where
attention to detail is key to success. XR will be able to bridge the
gap of visualising heavy equipment by enabling workers to actually
see and use a final product. Ford motors is already starting to use
Ford Immersive Vehicle Environment (FIVE) VR/XR technology so that
engineers can see how the interior appearance of a car will turn out
without having to create physical artifacts, cutting manufacturing
time by weeks. It is estimated that the use of XR technologies will
deliver a staggering $360 billion dollars within the manufacturing
industry by 2030 (Thomas 2020).
  </p>
  <h3>Tourism</h3>
  <p>
The
global travel industry’s contribution to GDP in 2019 was estimated
to be $2.9 trillion US dollars (Lock 2018), with the impact of
coronavirus set to drop 17% off global revenue over 2020, and effects
of this are likely to last far into the future. XR will enable the
industry to grow in ways that are currently unimagined, without your
having to physically travel or even leave your home or business. How
about a visit to Mars during your lunch break or a quick trip to
check production lines in your overseas warehouse (Scribani 2019).
Whilst unlikely that people will stop travelling to their favourite
destinations, tourism is unlikely to recover to where it was before
the pandemic, and if the industry wishes to reduce impact on GDP
contribution it will need to understand XR technologies to ensure
survival and begin to transform what tourism means to the world (Kwok
&amp; Koh 2020).
  </p>
  <p>
Other
impacts may be more personal. A survey conducted by the University of
Sydney business School’s Institute of Transport and Logistics
Studies (ITLS) found that 75% of workers believe that working from
home will become the standard over time (Booth 2020). We are already
seeing a rise in VR events and meetings (Bajarin 2020) which is
enabling people to stay in contact like never before and XR will only
cement events like this further by making them more interactive by
utilizing XR technologies. Further, a study conducted by the
University of Barcelona (Slater et al. 2020) with participants
including representatives of major companies and institutions such as
BBC R&amp;D, Digital Catapult, Dimension /Hammerhead VR, Facebook
London, NESTA, Jigsaw (part of Google), Magic Leap, Microsoft
Research, and University College London found that people will
struggle to separate real world and virtual world experiences,
potentially having significant impact on cognitive, emotional and
behavioural regulation. For example, you may not realise what
‘reality’ an event took place in, anger at your avatar being
insulted by a fictional character or realising that actions
acceptable in XR are not being acceptable in the real world.

  <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
  <p>
A
video created by Keiichi Matsuda (2016) titled Hyper-Reality
(<a href="http://hyper-reality.co/">http://hyper-reality.co/</a>)
(6 mins), shows how as a result of our virtual and physical realities
becoming more and more intertwined, we will begin to see a world
where they are no longer considered different. A world where even our
walking outside will be personalized for us, with advertisements and
personalized products appearing right there for us to interact with
using all of our senses.
  </p>
  <p>
As
XR begins to meet its full potential I feel that it will have a
positive effect on me. Job opportunities all over the world will
become available. I already conduct many interactions over the
internet and the ability to physically meet and interact with friends
on the other side of the world will be invaluable, especially as
impacts from coronavirus show no signs of going away anytime soon. 
  </p>
  <p>
With
the rise of XR I will have more time to spend at home with my family,
more time to experience the world in ways I did not think possible.
My largest concern will be the security of such technologies. How
will I prevent someone making a ‘copy’ of my digital self? As
shown in the article The Ethics of Realism in Virtual and Augmented
Reality (Frontiers in Virtual Reality 2020), ‘ … With
superrealism it will be possible to make virtual “copies” of
people that look, act, talk like a real person, even demonstrating
aspects of personality (for example through the use of machine
learning applied to behaviour based on recordings of the real
person)… ’. How we ensure the security of this technology will
determine its success and its direct impact on us.
