As outlined in
table 5, the ideal jobs for our group members are
somewhat like one another. Three of our team members wish
to work as Software Engineers, one of our group members
wish to work as Product Manager, and the last group member wishes to
work as a Service Desk Engineer. 
</p>
<p>
For
the software engineering role, the similarities between
roles include an ability to write code, prior
Information Technology experience and the capability of working
with others in a team environment. Although these jobs are
similar, two of our team members ideal roles do specialize in
AR/VR technology, this further adds required skills such as
exposure to VR/AR headsets and an understanding of AR/VR
technology. 
</p>
<p>
Although
the Software Engineer roles are similar the Service desk and
Product Manager roles are not. The Product Manager role
requires more experience with data analysis software and project
management whereas the Service desk role requires networking
knowledge and management of systems such as Office
365 and Active Directory. 
</p>
<p>
Although
all our ideal jobs may vary, one factor that is ubiquitous
across all these roles is teamwork. The ability
to work as a team is commonplace throughout the Information
Technology industry. This skill should be constantly developed and
built to enhance communication and team success.
